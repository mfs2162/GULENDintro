# Introduction paragraph

Welcome to my introduction to GULEND! I'm Melody Schwenk, and I'm a PhD student in in Educational Neurooscience at Gallaudet University. I'm passionate about using technology to understand and improve access for Deaf people. In this introduction, I'll give you a brief overview of my research interests and goals as well as who I am as a human.


# The World Through My Shoes üåçüëü

Who needs a plane ticket when you can globetrot with me virtually? From the canals of Venice to the bustling streets of Tokyo, I've made footprints all over. The map below paints my international escapades in a shade of dreamy teal. Let your wanderlust roam!
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Coast to Coast: My American Dream üá∫üá∏‚ú®
The Land of the Free, and the Home of the Brave... and quite a few of my travel tales! Charting my journey across the United States, this map splashes the states I've explored in a rosy hue. From sunny Californian beaches to the historic streets of Massachusetts, here's a peek into my American adventures.

# My Never-ending School Saga!

From the age of three, I've been hitting the books and chasing degrees. Now at 31, some might say I'm "over-educated" or perhaps just a professional student. But hey, who's counting? Dive into my educational odyssey below, where the school names speak volumes and the years tell tales!

# My Unique Skills & Hobbies Chart

The following interactive chart presents a whimsical take on the hobbies and unique skills I've developed over the years. Each dot represents a hobby or skill, with its position determined by the time I've spent on it and my proficiency in it.  

+ X-axis (Time Spent): This represents the average minutes per day I've dedicated to each hobby.
+ Y-axis (Proficiency): This is my self-rated proficiency level, where 1 indicates I'm a novice and 7 means I consider myself an expert.
+ Color Gradient: Hobbies where I'm closer to being a novice are in a light pink shade, while those where I'm an expert are in light blue.
+ Interactive Feature: Hover over each dot to see a description of the hobby or skill it represents.   
This will give you a lighthearted insight into my day-to-day activities and quirks!  
Now, dive in and explore! Don't forget to hover over each dot for a delightful description.
